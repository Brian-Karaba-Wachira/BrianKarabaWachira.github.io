I am a junior cybersecurity professional who has a great desire of securing systems from attackers. I like challenging myself to crack complicated codes and systems mimicking a real threat actor to see all the access points in a system. Besides whats the essense of being a cybersecurity professional if you dont enjoy breaking systems.

I enjoy working together with people cause at the end of the day ,its what matters in achieving the desired goals as a team.
