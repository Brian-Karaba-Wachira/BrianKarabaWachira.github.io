Its useless having tools if you dont have a means of using them. Apart from being a scholar in cybersecurity field,I stood a chance to be a vice chair in a club in our University. Within that time, I got the chance to hold the source code of our website.
I worked my way into taking the job of making sure the website was safe and practised my skills there.Though it was voluntary, I enjoyed doing it and it made me want to do it more in a professional way where critical systems which require security are involved.
