Upon enrolling in campus,I was admitted to a hostel which offered free wifi services.The wifi connection used to be low and it irritated me.
So one day i decided to investigate what causes that.Note that sometimes the connection was excellent.

So I collaborated with my hostelmates to know the maximum number of devices that are allowed to connect to a LAN wifi.
So we connected a device at a time,while concurrently adding another one.
As more devices were added,the connection lagged.Until the devices that could connect were 10.
There I came up to the conclusion that a maximum of 10 devices are allowed to connect to a LAN wifi.
